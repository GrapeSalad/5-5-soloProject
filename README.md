## INTRO
Ping - Pong based on user input. A simple javascript logic test to see if I am able to create a code that processes a user's input into a series of numbers and strings.

### SPECs
This program will:
1. Receive user input.
2. Count up from 1 to user input. For example: The user enters 6 so the program will count from 1-6.
3. Check count against 15, 5, 3 -> if the number is divisible by them return ping-pong, pong, ping respectively.
4. Return all numbers being counted that aren't changed as well as the changed numbers to the user in order.

### INSTALLATION
https://github.com/GrapeSalad/5-5-soloProject is the url that will provide access to the code.
To run on your computer follow these steps:
1. Open the git bash terminal (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Click on the link to my github project to view code
3. Click the green button that says "Clone or Download" and copy the link
4. In git bash create a new directory in your chosen folder to store the project (touch "yourDirectory")
5. Enter this command: git clone https://github.com/GrapeSalad/5-5-soloProject
6. If you have a default text editor installed git can help you open all of the files that you need to use in one command: git "your-text-editor" .
7. Edit and make it better!

### USAGE
