## INTRO
Ping - Pong based on user input. A simple javascript logic test to see if I am able to create a code that processes a user's input into a series of numbers and strings.

### SPECs
This program will:
1. Receive user input.
2. Count up from 1 to user input. For example: The user enters 6 so the program will count from 1-6.
3. Check count against 15, 5, 3 -> if the number is divisible by them return ping-pong, pong, ping respectively.
4. Return all numbers being counted that aren't changed as well as the changed numbers to the user in order.
5. Allow the user to play with a friend (functionality to be added at a later date).

| BEHAVIOR | INPUT | OUTPUT |
|---|---|---|
| SINGLE | PLAYER | VERSION |
|---|---|---|
| Not a Number entered | 1r5l | text box asks user to enter appropriate number |
| correct number entered | 15 | 1, 2, ping, 4, pong, ping, 7, 8, ping, pong, 11, ping, 13, 14, ping-pong |
|---|---|---|
| TWO | PLAYER | VERSION |
|---|---|---|
| players enter their respective inputs | 1-ping 2-pong | increase count by 3 and 5, respectively |
| players enter anything else | poing, p0ng, perllsnm | "Please enter ping for player one or pong for player two" |
